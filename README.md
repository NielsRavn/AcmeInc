###There should be a Main Menu that gives access to two submenu, one for entering a new diagnose 
and one for showing existing. When you enter a new diagnose you should specify the doctor, patient and his diagnose and then a vote should be 
automaticly set to 1 before returning to the main menu. The show menu should list all diagnoses, each being a menu one can enter. At the submenu 
one should be able to print a comment to the console, vote++, vote-- and Go back to the previous menu.
